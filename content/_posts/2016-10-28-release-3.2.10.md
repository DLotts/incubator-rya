This is Rya's first release, version {{ page.version }}.  It is available as a source code download:

- [Source download from Apache]({{ page.apacheRelease }})
- [Source download from Github]({{ page.githubRelease }})
- [Release Tag in Github](https://github.com/apache/incubator-rya/commit/{{ page.sha }})
- [Release notes]({{ page.releaseNotes }})

[Verify](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi#verify)
using the corresponding *pgp* signature (using the committer file in
[KEYS](http://www.apache.org/dist/{{ site.data.project.incubator_slash_name }}/KEYS)).
If you cannot do that, the *md5* hash file may be used to check that the
download has completed OK.

For fast downloads, current source distributions are hosted on mirror servers;
older source distributions are in the
[archive](http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/{{ site.data.project.unix_name }}/).
If a download from a mirror fails, retry, and the second download will likely
succeed.

For security, hash and signature files are always hosted at
[Apache](https://www.apache.org/dist).
